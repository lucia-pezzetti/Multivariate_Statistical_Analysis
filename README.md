# Multivariate Statistical Analysis

Repository for the UniTo __Multivariate Statistical Analysis__ of Professor Pierpaolo De Blasi in spring semester 2023.

Analysis and exercises have been conducted using the R programming language and are presented in Quarto format. Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc, which makes it highly effective for creating reproducible research documents.

Grade: 30 / 30 cum laude

## Problem Sets:

1. The first problem set includes three exercises:

   - __Analysis of State Data__: Involves the 'state.x77' dataset with 8 variables from 50 U.S. states (1977). Tasks include computing a correlation matrix, identifying univariate outliers, creating boxplots, assessing normality, analyzing scatter plots, and exploring multivariate normality and outliers.
   - __Principal Components Analysis__: Focuses on a normal distribution problem. Involves finding the inverse of a covariance matrix, eigenvalues, principal components accounting for significant variation, conditional distribution analysis, and sketching probability ellipses.
   - __Nutritional Data Analysis__: Uses data from 961 food items. The exercise requires standardizing variables, performing principal component analysis, deciding how many components to retain, interpreting principal components, identifying outliers, creating 3D scatter plots, and investigating multivariate normality and outliers.
  
2. The second problem set covers two exercises:

   - __Factor Analysis on Psychological Test Data__: This exercise involves a dataset of psychological tests given to students from two schools. It requires conducting factor analysis with various numbers of factors, interpreting common factors, creating scatter plots of factor scores, and comparing results between the two schools.
   - __Discriminant Analysis on Handwritten Digits Data__: This exercise uses a dataset of handwritten digits. Tasks include performing linear discriminant analysis, creating scatter plots with discriminant variables, computing confusion matrices, implementing cross-validation, and evaluating error rates for different classifiers.
